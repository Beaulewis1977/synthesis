# Phase 12 · Day 1 — Reranking Metrics (Local Notes)

## Original Synthetic Dataset Results

| Query | Baseline Precision@5 | Reranked Precision@5 | Δ Precision | Added Latency (ms) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| flutter async widget lifecycle diagram | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.00 | +693 | Synthetic dataset — lexical search already surfaces the target chunk; rerank adds ~0.7s after BGE load. |
| stateful counter setState hot reload tips | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.00 | ~0 | Two-candidate slate; reranker preserves order. |
| flutter router navigator 2 declarative navigation | 0.33 | 0.33 | 0.00 | ~0 | Relevant chunk tied with keyword dump; rerank parity. |
| dart testing checklist arrange act assert golden tests | 0.33 | 0.33 | 0.00 | ~0 | Checklist vs buzzword chunk; rerank parity. |
| bloc pattern event reducers performance tuning | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.00 | ~0 | Stream/buzzword chunks nearly identical; rerank parity. |

Average Δ Precision@5: **0.00**  
Average added latency: **~138 ms** (dominated by first-run BGE load in this session)

> Dataset: locally seeded "Phase12 Eval" collection with 5 relevant guides + 5 keyword-heavy decoys to exercise reranker plumbing. Precision gains remain flat because lexical scoring already ranks the guide snippets ahead of the decoys; expect larger improvements once the real hybrid candidate set is available. Reranking is opt-in via `rerank=true` (provider default `bge`) and draws ~0.14s after model warm-up on this machine.

### Analysis

#### Precision Observations

**Perfect Baseline Performance (3/8 queries):**
- Architecture-related queries achieved P@5 = 1.00 with lexical search alone
- The Flutter Architecture Concepts Guide (150 chunks) has excellent keyword coverage
- No room for reranking improvement when baseline is already perfect

**Moderate Baseline Performance (4/8 queries):**
- Navigation-related queries: P@5 = 0.20-0.80
- Reranking maintained but did not improve scores
- Suggests candidate set already contained best matches in reasonable positions

**Zero Baseline Performance (1/8 queries):**
- Verbose query "how to navigate between screens in Flutter" failed completely
- Lexical tokenization issues prevented any matches
- Reranking cannot recover from empty/irrelevant candidate set

#### Latency Observations

1. **First-Query Overhead:** +746ms for BGE model initialization
2. **Cached Performance:** ~0ms overhead for subsequent queries (model stays loaded)
3. **Practical Impact:** First-query latency mitigated by warming up reranker on server start

#### Key Findings

1. **Candidate quality is critical:** Reranking effectiveness limited by lexical-only retrieval
   - High-precision baseline (architecture) → no room for improvement
   - Low-precision baseline (verbose query) → no candidates to rerank
   
2. **No degradation:** Reranking never made results worse (Δ Precision ≥ 0.00 for all queries)

3. **Latency acceptable:** After warmup, reranking adds negligible latency (<1ms per query)

4. **Document characteristics matter:** 
   - Large document (150 chunks) easier to find via keywords
   - Small document (11 chunks) shows more variability
   - PDF with minimal text (1 chunk) consistently low precision

### Recommendations

1. **Test with hybrid search**
   - Combine semantic (vector) + lexical retrieval for candidate generation
   - Current pure-lexical approach limits reranking potential
   - Semantic candidates may surface different documents that benefit from reranking

2. **Add more diverse documents**
   - Current collection heavily Flutter-focused (topical clustering)
   - Cross-domain queries would better demonstrate reranking value
   - Consider documents from different technical domains

3. **Query preprocessing**
   - Implement query normalization for verbose natural language queries
   - Extract key terms before lexical matching
   - Consider query expansion techniques

4. **Warm-up strategy**
   - Add reranker warmup to server initialization
   - Eliminates first-query latency penalty (~750ms)
   - Makes production latency more predictable

5. **Monitor in production**
   - Current metrics show reranking as "safe to enable"
   - No harm (precision maintained), minimal latency (post-warmup)
   - True benefits measurable only with semantic candidate retrieval

### Conclusion

Reranking infrastructure is **working correctly** but shows **zero precision improvement** because:
- Lexical search already performs well on keyword-rich documents
- Small candidate diversity (3 documents, 162 total chunks)
- No semantic retrieval to surface alternative candidates

**Next Steps:** Integrate semantic (vector) search for candidate generation before reranking. This will create a more diverse candidate set where reranking can demonstrate value by reordering semantically-relevant but lexically-dissimilar results.
