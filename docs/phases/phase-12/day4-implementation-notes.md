# Phase 12 · Day 4 — Validation Notes (Draft for Issue #61)

## Summary

Validated Phase 12 backend by shipping full integration coverage, synthetic benchmark harness, and cost-verification tooling. Confirmed reranking + synthesis + cost tracking behave end-to-end and captured Day 4 metrics for the final PR package.

## What Was Implemented

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Added `apps/server/src/services/__tests__/integration.test.ts` exercising:
  - Hybrid search → rerank → trust-scoring interactions.
  - Synthesis clustering with contradiction detection and conflict penalties.
  - Cost tracking inserts + budget alerts (80% warning, 100% limit) and fallback overrides.
- ✅ Mocked Cohere/BGE, Anthropic, and DB surfaces to isolate flows while preserving existing modules.

### Cost Route Enhancements
- ✅ Refactored `apps/server/src/routes/costs.ts` to expose `registerCostRoutes(app, tracker)` for test reuse.
- ✅ Normalized budget parsing/percentage math and surfaced alerts via `CostTracker.getRecentAlerts()`.
- ✅ Ensured alerts serialize ISO timestamps for API clients.

### Cost Tracker Utilities
- ✅ Extended `apps/server/src/services/cost-tracker.ts` with `getRecentAlerts(limit)` helper (shared by routes + integration tests).
- ✅ Preserved async/non-blocking pattern; integration test verifies fallback env overrides.

### Benchmarking Assets
- ✅ Authored synthetic Flutter corpus (`docs/phases/phase-12/data/flutter_guides_corpus.json`) to unblock rerank metrics without external calls.
- ✅ Implemented `scripts/benchmark-phase12.ts` to generate 50+ query set, compute Precision@5/10, MRR, and latency.
- ✅ Stored run output in `docs/phases/phase-12/day4-benchmark-results.md` for audit trail.

## Metrics & Validation

| Metric | Baseline | Reranked | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Precision@5 | 0.000 | 0.125 | N/A (+0.125) |
| Precision@10 | 0.051 | 0.088 | +72.55% |
| MRR | 0.104 | 0.373 | +258.65% |
| Added latency | 0 ms | 0.21 ms | +0.21 ms |
| Latency p95 (ms) | 0.00 | 0.39 | +0.39 |
| Latency p99 (ms) | 0.03 | 0.58 | +0.55 |

Notes:
- Synthetic corpus (Flutter guides) approximates Phase 12 test set; real corpus benchmark scheduled post-import.
- Navigation queries showed no delta; needs evaluation against live embeddings once available.

## Testing & Tooling

```bash
pnpm --filter @synthesis/server test integration
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm build
pnpm --filter @synthesis/server typecheck
pnpm tsx scripts/benchmark-phase12.ts > docs/phases/phase-12/day4-benchmark-results.md
```

Existing unit suites remain green (reranker, synthesis, cost tracker, pipeline). Integration test logs budget fallback, confirming env overrides.

## Cost Tracking Verification

- Integration spec validates inserts + alerts with stubbed DB.
- Manual `psql` query confirmed connectivity (`api_usage` empty in fresh DB — expected until live traffic). Reference command:
  ```bash
  psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM api_usage ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
  ```
- Budget fallback toggles verified (`EMBEDDING_PROVIDER_OVERRIDE=ollama`, etc.).

## PR Checklist (prep for final merge)

- [ ] Reference Issue #61 (Phase 12 Epic).
- [ ] Include benchmark summary table + link to `day4-benchmark-results.md`.
- [ ] Confirm synthetic corpus + methodology disclaimer.
- [ ] Tests: `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm --filter @synthesis/server typecheck`.
- [ ] Note feature flags remain OFF by default (reranking opt-in, contradiction detection gated, cost alerts true).
- [ ] Attach acceptance criteria checklist (Phase 12 §07).

## Follow-Ups

- Re-run benchmarks on the real Flutter corpus once production embeddings land.
- Surface navigation-query regression (no precision gain) in Day 5 notes if persists with real data.
- Coordinate frontend Day 5 work (Issue #64) to consume synthesis conflicts + cost endpoints.
