## 🐳 Docker Containers (Clear Names)

You'll see these in Docker Desktop:

```
synthesis-db         # Postgres + pgvector
synthesis-ollama     # Local LLM (your 16GB GPU)
synthesis-server     # Fastify backend
synthesis-web        # React frontend
synthesis-mcp        # MCP server
```

**No confusion!** Each service clearly named with `synthesis-` prefix.

## 🌿 Git Workflow (Main/Develop)

### Branch Strategy
```
main (protected, empty until MVP)
  └── develop (default, active development)
        ├── feature/phase-1-database
        ├── feature/phase-2-ingestion
        └── ... (feature branches for each phase)
```

### PR Process
```
Feature branch → Push → PR to develop → Review Agent approves
  → CodeRabbit approves → Merge to develop → Delete branch
  
When MVP complete: develop → PR to main → Deploy to production
```

**Commit format:** Conventional Commits  
**PR template:** Included  
**Branch protection:** Full rules specified

---

## 🤖 Agent Workflow

### How Agents Will Build

```
Phase Start
  ↓
Builder Agent: Implement + Test
  ↓
Builder Agent: Create Phase Summary (using template)
  ↓
Review Agent: Review summary + code
  ↓
Review Agent: Approve or request changes
  ↓
Create feature branch (feature/phase-X-name)
  ↓
Commit with conventional commits
  ↓
Push + Create PR to develop
  ↓
CodeRabbit: Automated review
  ↓
Merge when both approve
  ↓
Next phase
```

**Phase Summary Template:** Comprehensive checklist format  
**Review Criteria:** Clear quality gates  
**Manual Review Points:** Before each commit

---

## 🔧 CI/CD Pipeline

### On Every PR:
1. **Lint** (Biome) - 30s
2. **Type Check** (TypeScript) - 45s
3. **Unit Tests** (Vitest) - 60s
4. **Build** (All packages) - 90s
5. **Integration Tests** (With Postgres) - 120s
6. **Docker Build** (All services) - 180s

**Total:** ~6-8 minutes  
**Merge Blocked:** If any fail  
**CodeRabbit:** Runs in parallel

### On Merge to develop:
- Auto-deploy to staging (future)

### On Merge to main:
- Create GitHub release
- Build production Docker images
- Deploy to production (future)

---

## ⏱️ Timeline: 7-9 Days

### Breakdown
- **Day 0:** Setup (2-3 hours) - Install everything
- **Days 1-2:** Database + ingestion pipeline
- **Days 3-4:** Agent tools + autonomous search
- **Day 5:** Basic UI (functional, not beautiful)
- **Day 6:** MCP server (WSL + Windows)
- **Day 7:** Docker integration + testing
- **Days 8-9:** Polish, testing, documentation

**After Day 9:** You have a working autonomous RAG system!

---

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Development (Days 1-9)
- Ollama: FREE
- Postgres: FREE  
- Claude API (testing): ~$50-100

### Production (Monthly)
- Claude Agent SDK: ~$200-300/month (autonomy)
- Ollama embeddings: FREE (your GPU)
- Infrastructure: FREE (Docker local)

**Total: ~$200-300/month for autonomous agent**

**Why worth it?** Agent manages your knowledge base autonomously, fetches docs, maintains collections. Saves hours of manual work.

---

## 🎨 UI Approach

### MVP (Days 1-9)
- **Simple & functional**
- ASCII wireframes included in `08_UI_SPEC.md`
- 5 pages: Dashboard, Collection View, Upload, Chat, New Collection modal
- Tailwind CSS for basic styling
- No fancy animations
- Desktop-first

### Phase 2 (After MVP Works)
- **Use your beautiful mockups**
- Add animations
- Mobile responsive
- Dark mode
- Advanced features

**Philosophy:** Function first, beauty second

## ✅ What Makes This Special

### Compared to Original Plan

| Original | New Plan | Improvement |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 30-40 days | 7-9 days | ✅ 4x faster |
| SaaS focus | Personal tool | ✅ Matches your need |
| 10 tables | 3 tables | ✅ Simpler |
| Manual tools | Autonomous agent | ✅ True autonomy |
| 22 docs | 19 docs | ✅ Focused |
| Cloud only | Local + cloud | ✅ Cost-effective |
| No MCP focus | MCP-native | ✅ IDE agents priority |
| Generic | Agent-driven build | ✅ Clear workflow |

### Key Innovations

1. **Claude Agent SDK** - True autonomous orchestration, not just API calls
2. **Local embeddings** - FREE with Ollama, your GPU
3. **Dual MCP modes** - WSL (stdio) + Windows (SSE) for all agents
4. **Docker named containers** - No confusion in Docker Desktop
5. **Phase-based with reviews** - Quality gates before every commit
6. **Multi-project from day 1** - Collections baked into architecture
7. **Toggle LLM** - Switch between Claude (quality) and Ollama (cost)

**Yes!** ASCII wireframes in `08_UI_SPEC.md` for all pages. Simple, functional MVP UI. Your beautiful mockups = Phase 2.

### "Anything else agents need?"
**No!** Everything is crystal clear:
- Detailed specs for every component
- Step-by-step build plan
- Phase summary template
- Review workflow
- Git/PR process
- CI/CD automation
- Error handling patterns
- Testing requirements

**An agent can start Day 1 with zero ambiguity.**
