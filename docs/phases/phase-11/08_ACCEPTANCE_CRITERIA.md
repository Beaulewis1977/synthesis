# Phase 11: Acceptance Criteria

**Validation checklist before marking complete**

---

## ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

### Core Features

- [ ] **Hybrid Search Works**
  - Can execute hybrid search combining vector + BM25
  - Returns results with `source` field ('vector', 'bm25', or 'both')
  - Results ranked by fused score (RRF algorithm)
  
- [ ] **Multi-Provider Embeddings**
  - Can embed with Ollama (nomic-embed-text, 768d)
  - Can embed with OpenAI (text-embedding-3-large, 1536d)
  - Can embed with Voyage (voyage-code-2, 1024d)
  - Provider auto-selection works based on content type
  
- [ ] **Metadata Tracking**
  - Documents store: source_quality, framework, framework_version
  - Chunks store: embedding_model, embedding_provider, embedding_dimensions
  - Can query documents by metadata fields
  
- [ ] **Trust Scoring**
  - Official sources weighted at 1.0
  - Verified sources weighted at 0.85
  - Community sources weighted at 0.6
  - Scores affect final ranking

### Backwards Compatibility

- [ ] **Zero Breaking Changes**
  - Existing collections work without modification
  - Old search API continues to function
  - MCP tools work without changes
  - Agent tools work without changes
  - Frontend doesn't break

- [ ] **Gradual Adoption**
  - Can set `SEARCH_MODE=vector` (old behavior)
  - Can set `SEARCH_MODE=hybrid` (new behavior)
  - Per-collection override via metadata
  - Defaults to vector mode if env not set

---

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [ ] **BM25 Service**
  - `bm25Search()` returns exact keyword matches
  - Handles empty queries gracefully
  - Respects topK parameter
  - Normalizes scores to 0-1 range

- [ ] **Hybrid Search**
  - `hybridSearch()` combines vector + BM25 results
  - RRF fusion algorithm correct
  - Handles cases where only vector returns results
  - Handles cases where only BM25 returns results
  - Handles overlap correctly (same chunk in both)

- [ ] **Embedding Router**
  - `selectEmbeddingProvider()` detects code content
  - Auto-selects Voyage for code
  - Auto-selects OpenAI for personal writings
  - Defaults to Ollama for general docs
  - Respects collection metadata override

- [ ] **Metadata Builder**
  - Creates valid metadata objects
  - Auto-detects source quality from URL
  - Auto-detects language from file extension
  - Sets defaults for required fields

### Integration Tests

- [ ] **End-to-End Search**
  - Insert test document ‚Üí Embed ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Find it
  - Hybrid search finds both semantic and exact matches
  - Trust scoring affects ranking order
  - Version filtering works

- [ ] **MCP Integration**
  - `search_rag` tool returns hybrid results
  - External agents see improved accuracy
  - No errors in MCP communication

### Performance Tests

- [ ] **Latency Benchmarks**
  - Vector-only search: <200ms
  - BM25-only search: <100ms
  - Hybrid search: <600ms
  - No regressions in vector-only mode

- [ ] **Load Tests**
  - Can handle 100 concurrent searches
  - Database indexes used correctly
  - No memory leaks

---

## üìä Quality Metrics

### Retrieval Accuracy

- [ ] **Improvement Measured**
  - Test on 50+ queries
  - Hybrid beats vector-only by 20%+ (measured on relevant test set)
  - Exact match recall: >95%
  - No decrease in semantic relevance

### Code Quality

- [ ] **Clean Implementation**
  - No TypeScript errors
  - No linting errors
  - Follows existing code style
  - Functions <50 lines where possible
  - Clear variable names
  - Adequate comments

- [ ] **Test Coverage**
  - New code: >80% coverage
  - Critical paths: 100% coverage
  - Edge cases handled

---

## üîí Security & Stability

### API Key Management

- [ ] **Safe Storage**
  - API keys in .env, not code
  - .env.example documents required keys
  - No keys committed to git

- [ ] **Fallback Behavior**
  - System works without OpenAI key (uses Ollama)
  - System works without Voyage key (uses Ollama)
  - Error messages don't expose keys

### Error Handling

- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**
  - API failures fall back to Ollama
  - BM25 errors don't break hybrid search
  - Invalid metadata doesn't crash queries
  - Malformed queries return 400, not 500

---

## üìñ Documentation

- [ ] **Code Documentation**
  - Public functions have JSDoc comments
  - Complex algorithms explained (RRF)
  - README updated with new env vars

- [ ] **User Documentation**
  - How to enable hybrid search
  - How to configure providers
  - How to use metadata filtering
  - Migration guide for existing collections

- [ ] **API Documentation**

# 2. Show multi-provider routing
# Check logs to see which provider was used
tail -f logs/server.log | grep "Embedding provider selected"

    "query":"authentication",
    "collection_id":"flutter-docs",
    "filters":{"framework":"flutter","framework_version":">=3.24.0"}

# 5. Test MCP integration
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"search_rag","arguments":{"query":"StatefulWidget","collection_id":"flutter-docs"}}}' | \
