# Phase 12 · Day 2 — Implementation Notes (Draft for Issue #61)

- Created `apps/server/src/services/synthesis.ts` to cluster top hybrid results, compute consensus scores, summarize approaches, and select recommendations while coordinating with contradiction detection.
- Added `apps/server/src/services/contradiction-detection.ts` with Anthropic-backed analysis gated by `ENABLE_CONTRADICTION_DETECTION`, lexical prefiltering, configurable thresholds, and resilient JSON parsing.
- Exposed `POST /api/synthesis/compare` via `apps/server/src/routes/synthesis.ts`, registered it in `apps/server/src/index.ts`, and guarded execution behind `ENABLE_SYNTHESIS` with reranking enabled by default.
- Documented new env toggles (`ENABLE_SYNTHESIS`, `ENABLE_CONTRADICTION_DETECTION`, `CONTRADICTION_*`) in `.env.example` and `apps/server/.env.example`; tightened Cohere fallback detection in `apps/server/src/services/reranker.ts`.
- Added Vitest coverage for synthesis clustering/penalties, contradiction detection flag behaviour, and the synthesis route handler.
