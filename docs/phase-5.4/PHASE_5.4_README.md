# Phase 5.4 Upload Implementation - README

## üìÑ Files Created for You

I've created two comprehensive guides for implementing the missing upload functionality:

### 1. **PHASE_5.4_UPLOAD_PROMPT.md** - Agent Instructions
   - Complete prompt for the AI agent
   - All documentation references
   - Technical specifications
   - Testing checklist
   - Acceptance criteria

### 2. **GIT_WORKFLOW_PHASE_5.4.md** - Git Guide
   - Step-by-step git commands
   - Branch management strategy
   - Commit and PR instructions
   - Troubleshooting tips

---

## üéØ Quick Start

### For the Agent:
```bash
# Give the agent this prompt file
cat PHASE_5.4_UPLOAD_PROMPT.md

# The agent should read these docs in order:
# 1. docs/00_START_HERE.md
# 2. docs/15_AGENT_PROMPTS.md
# 3. PHASE_5.1_SUMMARY.md
# 4. PHASE_5.2_SUMMARY.md  
# 5. PHASE_5.3_SUMMARY.md
# 6. docs/08_UI_SPEC.md
# 7. docs/09_BUILD_PLAN.md (lines 265-300)
# 8. docs/05_API_SPEC.md (POST /api/ingest)
# 9. docs/14_GITHUB_ISSUES.md (lines 500-512)
```

### For You (Git Management):
```bash
# Follow the git workflow guide
cat GIT_WORKFLOW_PHASE_5.4.md

# Key decision: Phase 5 was already merged to develop
# So create a NEW branch from develop for Phase 5.4
```

## üîç What's Missing from Phase 5?

Phase 5.3 was incomplete, delivering only the chat functionality while skipping the upload feature.

The complete technical breakdown of what needs to be built, including file names, code modifications, and acceptance criteria, is detailed in the primary agent prompt:
- **`PHASE_5.4_UPLOAD_PROMPT.md`**

That document is the single source of truth for the implementation details.

## üéì Why This Happened

The agent who worked on Phase 5.3 only implemented the chat functionality
and completely skipped the upload functionality that was supposed to be
in the same phase. This is a common issue when an AI agent focuses on
one part of a multi-part task.

**Lesson:** Always check GitHub issues/task lists are 100% complete before
marking a phase as done.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Give prompt to agent:**
   ```bash
   # Copy PHASE_5.4_UPLOAD_PROMPT.md to agent
   ```

2. **Agent reads documentation and asks questions**

3. **Agent confirms ready:**
   - Says "READY TO IMPLEMENT PHASE 5.4"

4. **Agent implements upload functionality**

5. **You follow git workflow:**
   - Use GIT_WORKFLOW_PHASE_5.4.md as guide
   - Create branch from `develop`
   - Agent commits changes
   - Create PR

6. **Review and merge**

7. **Phase 5 is FINALLY complete! üéâ**
