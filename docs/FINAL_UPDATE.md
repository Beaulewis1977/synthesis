## üí° Key Insights

### Why Agent Prompts Matter
**Without perfect prompts:**
- You might forget to mention important docs
- Agent might miss key requirements
- Inconsistent context between phases
- You have to re-explain things
- Higher chance of errors

**With perfect prompts (what we have):**
- ‚úÖ All context included
- ‚úÖ References to right docs
- ‚úÖ Acceptance criteria clear
- ‚úÖ MCP usage instructions
- ‚úÖ Git workflow reminders
- ‚úÖ Just copy and paste
- ‚úÖ Consistent quality

### Why GitHub Issues Help
- Clear backlog
- Easy to track "what's done"
- Link PRs to issues in commits
- Project management visibility
- Can assign to different agents
- **But you can build without them using just the prompts!**

### Why MCP Servers Matter
- Agent gets stuck? Search planning docs
- Technical error? Search web
- Complex problem? Use sequential thinking
- **Makes agent more autonomous**
- **Reduces back-and-forth with you**
