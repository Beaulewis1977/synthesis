# Phase 5.4: UI - Upload Functionality (Completion)

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Agent:** [Your Name]  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**Branch:** Create `feature/phase-5.4-upload` from `develop`

---

## üéØ Context: What Happened?

Phase 5 was split into 3 sub-phases:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5.1** - UI setup and layout (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5.2** - Dashboard and collection pages (COMPLETE)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phase 5.3** - Chat interface (COMPLETE) + Upload functionality (MISSING)

**Phase 5.3 only delivered 50% of the requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Chat interface implemented
- ‚ùå Upload functionality completely skipped

**Your job:** Complete the missing upload functionality to finish Phase 5.

```bash
docs/11_GIT_WORKFLOW.md        # How to commit and create PRs
```

---

## üéØ What You're Building

### **Missing Components:**

1. **UploadZone Component** (`apps/web/src/components/UploadZone.tsx`)
   - Drag & drop file upload
   - File picker fallback
   - Multiple file support
   - File type validation (PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT)
   - Upload progress indicators
   - Error handling per file

2. **Upload Page** (`apps/web/src/pages/UploadPage.tsx`)
   - Use UploadZone component
   - Display list of files to upload
   - Show upload progress
   - Handle `/api/ingest` endpoint
   - Display success/error states
   - Navigate back after upload

3. **Wire Upload Button** (Update `apps/web/src/pages/CollectionView.tsx`)
   - Currently the Upload button does nothing (line 56-58)
   - Make it navigate to `/upload/:collectionId`

4. **Add Upload Route** (Update `apps/web/src/App.tsx`)
   - Add route: `/upload/:collectionId`
   - Wire to UploadPage component

5. **API Integration** (Update `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`)
   - Add `uploadDocument()` function
   - Use FormData for multipart upload
   - Handle progress callbacks

---

## üîß Technical Specifications

### API Endpoint (Already exists in backend)
```typescript
POST /api/ingest
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:
- collection_id: string (UUID)
- files: File[] (one or more files)

Response:
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "doc_id": "uuid",
      "title": "filename.pdf",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

### File Type Support
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- Word Documents (`.docx`)
- Markdown (`.md`)
- Plain Text (`.txt`)

### Upload Flow
1. User clicks "Upload" button in CollectionView
2. Navigates to `/upload/:collectionId`
3. User drags files or clicks to select
4. Files are validated (type, size)
5. Upload starts with progress indicator
6. Success: Shows confirmation, navigates back
7. Error: Shows error message, allows retry

---

## üìÅ Files to Create

```
apps/web/src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UploadZone.tsx        # NEW - Drag & drop component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UploadPage.tsx        # NEW - Upload page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (updates to existing files below)
```

---

## üìù Files to Modify

### 1. `apps/web/src/App.tsx`
Add upload route:
```typescript
<Route path="upload/:collectionId" element={<UploadPage />} />
```

### 2. `apps/web/src/pages/CollectionView.tsx`
Line 56-58, change from:
```typescript
<button type="button" className="btn btn-secondary">
  Upload
</button>
```

To:
```typescript
<button 
  type="button" 
  className="btn btn-secondary"
  onClick={() => navigate(`/upload/${id}`)}
>
  Upload
</button>
```

### 3. `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`
Add method:
```typescript
async uploadDocument(
  collectionId: string, 
  files: File[], 
  onProgress?: (progress: number) => void
): Promise<UploadResponse>
```

### 4. `apps/web/src/types/index.ts`
Add types:
```typescript
export interface UploadResponse {
  documents: {
    doc_id: string;
    title: string;
    status: string;
  }[];
}
```

- Error states per file

### UploadPage Layout
- Page title: "Upload Documents"
- Collection name display

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
1. **Navigation Test:**

   - Select multiple files (PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT)
   - Files should appear in list

3. **Upload Test:**
   - Click "Upload All"
   - Progress bars should appear
   - Success message after completion
   - Navigate back to collection
   - New documents should appear

4. **Error Test:**
   - Try uploading unsupported file type
   - Should show validation error
   - Try uploading with backend stopped

   - Remove file before uploading
   - Navigate away during upload

## üîÑ Git Workflow Strategy

**CRITICAL:** You MUST follow the detailed git instructions in `GIT_WORKFLOW_PHASE_5.4.md`.

That document contains vital information about the project's branch history and the correct strategy for this task.

**Summary of the correct workflow:**
1.  You will **NOT** work on the `feature/phase-5-ui` branch.
2.  You will create a **NEW** branch named `feature/phase-5.4-upload` from the `develop` branch.
3.  All your commits for this task will be on the `feature/phase-5.4-upload` branch.

Refer to `GIT_WORKFLOW_PHASE_5.4.md` for the exact commands. Do not deviate from that guide.

---

## üìã Phase Summary Template

After completing, create `PHASE_5.4_SUMMARY.md` using this structure:

## üö® Important Notes

### DO NOT:
- ‚ùå Merge anything to `main` (it's protected)
- ‚ùå Commit Phase 6 changes (they're on separate branch)
- ‚ùå Create new environment variables (use existing)
- ‚ùå Change backend API (just use what exists)
- ‚ùå Skip error handling
- ‚ùå Skip TypeScript types

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Work on your `feature/phase-5.4-upload` branch (do not use `feature/phase-5-ui`)
- ‚úÖ Follow conventional commit format
- ‚úÖ Test thoroughly before committing
- ‚úÖ Create comprehensive phase summary
- ‚úÖ Handle loading/error/empty states
- ‚úÖ Use existing UI design tokens from Tailwind config
- ‚úÖ Follow React best practices
- ‚úÖ Use React Query for mutations

---

## üí° Implementation Tips

### UploadZone Component
- Use native HTML5 drag & drop events
- Use `<input type="file" multiple />` for file picker
- Use React state to track selected files
- Use `react-query` useMutation for upload
- Show individual progress per file (if possible)
- Allow removing files before upload

### Error Handling
- Network errors (backend down)
- Validation errors (wrong file type)
- Size limits (>100MB warning)
- Timeout errors
- User feedback for each error type

### Progress Tracking
- Use XMLHttpRequest or Fetch with progress
- Show percentage per file
- Overall progress indicator
- Disable upload button during upload
- Allow cancellation (bonus)

## üîó Helpful Code References

### Existing Components to Learn From
```bash
apps/web/src/components/CollectionCard.tsx    # Component structure
apps/web/src/components/DocumentList.tsx      # List handling
apps/web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx               # Page structure, React Query
apps/web/src/lib/api.ts                       # API client patterns
```

### Similar Patterns in Codebase
- File operations: `apps/server/src/routes/ingest.ts`
- React Query mutations: `apps/web/src/pages/CollectionView.tsx` (delete mutation)
- Error handling: All existing pages have examples
