## 💰 Cost Compliance

### Budget Targets

  - 1,000 searches/month
  - With reranking enabled
  - Typical usage pattern
  
- [ ] **Monthly Cost <$0.20 with BGE Only**
  - Only Claude for contradiction detection
  - ~100 synthesis requests/month

### Cost Accuracy

  - Cohere costs within 1% of actual
  - OpenAI costs within 1% of actual
  - Voyage costs within 1% of actual
  - Total monthly accurate within 5%

## 🔒 Security & Stability

### API Key Management

- [ ] **Safe Storage**
  - COHERE_API_KEY in .env only
  - No keys in code or logs
  - Error messages don't expose keys
  
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**
  - Works without Cohere key (uses BGE)
  - Works without OpenAI key (uses Ollama)
  - No crashes on missing keys

### Error Handling

- [ ] **Provider Failures**
  - Cohere 429 (rate limit) → exponential backoff
  - Cohere 500 (server error) → fallback to BGE
  - BGE model load failure → clear error message
  - Network timeout → fallback or retry
  
- [ ] **Data Integrity**
  - Cost tracking failures don't break search
  - Synthesis failures return partial results
  - Database errors logged but don't crash service
